A S/MIME library for JavaMail
(groupID: net.markenwerk, artifactId: utils-mail-smime)

Changes made while creating this library from the 'JavaMail-Crypto API':

1. The base package name has been changed from 'net.suberic.crypto' to
   'net.markenwerk.utils.mail.smime' to clarify that this library is a
   a new project.
   
2. While the 'JavaMail-Crypto API' intended to be a single API for multiple
   email encryption formats, this library only intends to provide support for
   S/MIME. Therefore, this library incorporates parts from the base library as
   well as from the Bouncy Castle based S/MIME provider into a single project.
   
3. The class BouncySMIMEEncryptionKeyManager became the class SmimeKeyStore
   which is reduced to the functionality needed to import a PKCS12 keystore.
   
4. The class BouncySMIMEEncryptionKey became the class SmimeKey which is reduced
   to the functionality needed to hold a private key and a certificate key chain
   imported from a PKCS12 keystore.
   
5. The class SMIMEEncryptionUtils became the class SmimeUtil which provides
   roughly the same functionality and has been made compatible with the current
   version of Bouncy Castle.
   
6. The class MimeUtils has been renamed to MimeUtil but is mostly unchanged
   otherwise.
   
7. The class UpdatableMBP has been renamed to UpdateableMimeBodyPart
   but is mostly unchanged otherwise.
