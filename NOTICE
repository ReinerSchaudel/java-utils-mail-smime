A S/MIME library for JavaMail
(groupID: net.markenwerk, artifactId: utils-mail-smime)

The initial version of this library is based on the S/MIME specific parts of a
project called 'JavaMail-Crypto API' (http://javamail-crypto.sourceforge.net/).

The 'JavaMail-Crypto API' uses a project called 'The Legion of the Bouncy Castle'
(http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) as a provider for the necessary
cryptography.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a rough overview of the changes made
to the 'JavaMail-Crypto API'. Keep and extend this file if you want to create a
modified version of this library or base a new project on this library.
